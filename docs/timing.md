# Frame pacing and the 30/60 fps split (spike S8, 2026-10-05)

Source: Ghidra decompile of `FUN_0886511c` (0x0886511c-0x08865357), the end-of-frame routine, in `out/limiter.txt`.
Addresses are for US v2.00 (UCUS-98612). The CWCheat "60 fps" code `0x200652A8` targets `0x088652A8`.

## What the routine does, in order
1. `FUN_088eda8c(0,0)`: GE sync (this function is the only caller of `sceGeDrawSync`; it also calls `sceGeListSync`).
2. Display-list bookkeeping (`FUN_08866200`, `FUN_088662fc`, `FUN_088913d8`, `FUN_08866498`, `FUN_08897f20`).
3. If a debug byte at `0x08a8f1fc` is set: a debug overlay (`FUN_08865f7c`, which animates with `sceDisplayGetVcount`).
4. `sceKernelGetGPI()` bits 0x40/0x20 switch `sceDisplaySetMode` between mode 0 and debug modes 0x60/0x1a at 480x272.
   GPI is the dev-kit switch block; on retail it reads 0, so mode 0 is used. Our HLE returns 0.
5. Pacing, chosen by GPI bit 0x80 (always 0 on retail), then by two fields of the frame object `param_1`:
   - if `*(u8*)(param_1+0x116c) == 0` (mode is vblank-locked) **or** `*(int*)(param_1+0x117c) != 0` (a countdown
     of frames that forces locking, decremented here): `n = 2 - (sceDisplayGetVcount() - lastVcount)`, clamped to
     1..2, then `n` times `sceDisplayWaitVblankStartCB()`. That is a **30 fps lock**: two vblanks per frame.
   - else `sceKernelDelayThreadCB(150)`: the frame runs free, bounded only by the GE sync in step 1. This is the
     "60 fps target" of Single Race and Tournament; the actual rate is whatever the frame costs.
6. `lastVcount = sceDisplayGetVcount()`.
7. `FUN_088ef6b8()`: frame-buffer swap (one of the three `sceDisplaySetFrameBuf` callers), result stored at
   `param_1+0x5df1`.

The cheat replaces the `bne a0,zero,0x08865298` at `0x088652a8` (the loop branch of step 5) with a NOP, so the
locked modes wait one vblank instead of two. Game logic that advances per frame then runs at double speed, which is
the reported "double speed in 30 fps areas".

## Consequences for the runtime
- Implement on the virtual clock: `sceDisplayGetVcount` (vblank counter), `sceDisplayWaitVblankStartCB` (block
  until the next vblank, run callbacks), `sceKernelDelayThreadCB`, `sceDisplaySetMode`, `sceDisplaySetFrameBuf`,
  `sceKernelGetGPI` (returns 0). Yakumo does not register `sceDisplayWaitVblankStart*` (MHP3rd paces through
  `sceCtrlReadBuffer`), so this is new HLE for M2 (patch 0002 or `src/hle/display_pure.cpp`).
- The free-running modes are bounded by `FUN_088eda8c`'s GE sync: with a fast GPU backend they will reach the
  60 fps vblank rate; the vblank itself must still tick at 59.94 Hz on the virtual clock so `GetVcount` is sane.
- E4 (60 fps in locked modes) is not a one-instruction patch for us: the right change is to find what reads
  `param_1+0x116c` (the per-mode lock flag) and what advances per frame while locked. Callers of `sceDisplayGetVcount`:
  `FUN_0886511c`, `FUN_08865f7c` (debug overlay), `LoadingScreen_cpp__088822dc` (loading screen animation).
- Input is read by `FUN_08898568` / `FUN_0889859c` (`sceCtrlReadBufferPositive`), not tied to pacing.

## Open
- Which modes set `+0x116c` (expected: Single Race, Tournament) and where `+0x117c` is loaded (expected: after a
  load or a pause, to settle the frame time).
- Frame structure: `FUN_088ed190` and `FUN_088ed284` enqueue display lists (`sceGeListEnQueue`); `FUN_088eda8c`
  syncs; `FUN_088ef5a8`/`FUN_088ef650`/`FUN_088ef6b8` set the frame buffer. See `out/frame.txt`.

## Frame structure (from `out/frame.txt`)
- `FUN_088ed190` is the GE init: `sceGeEdramGetAddr`, `sceKernelCreateEventFlag`, `sceGeSetCallback` (one callback
  set with signal/finish handlers that set the event flag), then an initial `sceGeListEnQueue` + `sceGeListSync`.
  This is the sceGu library pattern; the game links a sceGu-like layer, not raw GE commands scattered in game code.
- `FUN_088ed284` is the per-frame `sceGeListEnQueue` (display list start, stall address, callback id, args).
- `FUN_088eda8c` is `sceGuSync`-like: `sceGeListSync` then `sceGeDrawSync` with the mode arguments it receives.
- `FUN_088ef5a8` sets mode and frame buffer at init (`sceDisplaySetMode` + `sceDisplaySetFrameBuf`); `FUN_088ef650`
  and `FUN_088ef6b8` are the two swap variants (`sceDisplaySetFrameBuf` with different sync modes). The end-of-frame
  routine calls `FUN_088ef6b8`.
For the runtime this means: GE callbacks must be delivered as guest interrupts that set an event flag (Yakumo does
this), `sceGeListSync`/`sceGeDrawSync` must block until the list is done on the virtual clock, and
`sceDisplaySetFrameBuf` with the "next vblank" mode must take effect at the next vblank, not immediately.
